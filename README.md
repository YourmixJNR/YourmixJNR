### Hi there 👋

I'm Michael Victor.

I’m a Front-End Developer located in Nigeria. I have a serious passion for UI effects, animations and creating intuitive, dynamic user experiences.

I focus on HTML, CSS and Javascript. And I also use frontend frameworks such as Bootstarp, Tailwind and React.

Adobe XD, Figma and ProtoPie are my design stack software.

PHP, JAVA and Nodejs are some backend I'm proficient at, but PHP is still my favorite.

I have passion for technology and how it solves specific problems daily. Its my desire to contribute my quota to making the world a much better place using technology.
